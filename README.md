# Image-classification
• Implemented deep learning by using and fine-tuning the pre-trained model “EfficientNetB0” to classify 420 images into 10 categories and 30
landmarks
• Conducted data preprocessing: image transformation and normalization
• Tackled the challenge of a limited dataset by applying data augmentation strategies
• Delivered outstanding performance with classification accuracies of approximately 95% for category assignments and 80% for landmark 
recognition
